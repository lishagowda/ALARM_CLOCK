# ALARM_CLOCK
This code is to generate an Alarm Clock with the Indian Standard Time and when the time is set and activated the alarm will make sound at a particular time at where the alarm is set. And the Alarm Clock will not stop until the time or clock is deactivated from the timer set.
This is all about the project.
